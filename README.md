You think you see everything 👀👀 twice? No need to worry!

What started as a small tech demo 🐟 has grown faster and has become bigger than originally thought.

After version 1.3.1, tech demos 🦘and docs 📚 were separated from the reusable components. 🧹

Therefore the `astro-vt-bot`repository was renamed `astro-vtbot-website`.

The reusable components, which are also published on 🅽🅿🅼, got their own `astro-vtbot` repository.

# You can find all the news about the 👜 bag of tricks ✨ on the `astro-vtbot` [page](https://github.com/martrapp/astro-vtbot/#readme)!
