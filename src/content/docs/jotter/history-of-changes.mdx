If you want to know what has changed in the <BoT/>, go [to the CHANGELOG](https://github.com/martrapp/astro-vtbot/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

If you want to know what updates I've made to the Jotter, you've come to the right place.

This history starts when the Jotter first leveraged Starlight on 2024-04-01.
The most important changes since the first release relate to the Starlight Guide. The changes are mainly based on user feedback and the fact that I have learned more about things.
