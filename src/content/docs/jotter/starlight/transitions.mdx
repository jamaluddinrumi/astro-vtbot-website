title: Defining Transitions
---

This page gives a first overview on how to add transitions to a view transition enabled Starlight site.

Visit the [corresponding section in the introduction](/jotter/starlight/#add-transition-directives) to see where we are in  the big picture of The Bag's Starlight support.

When you follow the initial three steps of [the guide](/jotter/starlight/guide/), you enabled the default fade animations on the `<html>` root element for browsers with native view transition support and no animations on other browsers.

## Adding directives

To add transitions, you want to use [Astro's `transition:*Â´ directives](/jotter/astro/directives/).

There are some problems now:
- The directives must be added to some HTML elements.  You do not write HTML. You write Markdown.
- Ok, you can add HTML elements to `*.mdx` files. Sadly, the directives only work in `*.astro` files, not with `*.mdx` files. But you can use Astro components in `*.mdx` files, and they can use the directives.
- You could override more of Starlight's built-in components.

I would advise against the last point unless you find yourself in a situation where it is really necessary. I think in most cases the element you would choose for a transition group is the main area of the Starlight page anyway, right?

## Teleport Magic

Since we don't want to dig into the guts of Starlight, The Bag provides a special teleport functionality. Simply place your `transition:*` directives on the `<VtbotStarlight>` component in your new `<Head>` component and The Bag will beam them to the `<main>` element of Starlight's main content area.

```astro title="src/components/starlight/Head.astro" showLineNumbers=false {4,5}
{/* Define a view transition animation for `<main>`*/}
<VtbotStarlight
	{...Astro.props}
	transition:name="main"
	transition:animate={slide({ duration: 300 })}
>
	<StarlightHead {...Astro.props}><slot /></StarlightHead>
</VtbotStarlight>
```


## Scott me up, Beamy!
If you are interested, this is how that teleporting thing works. You have [seen these fragments before](/jotter/starlight/integration/#structure-of-the-base-component):
```ts title="astro-vtbot/components/starlight/Base.astro" showLineNumbers=false
...
export interface Props extends StarlightProps {
	...
	'data-astro-transition-scope'?: string;
	...
}
const { ... 'data-astro-transition-scope': mainTransitionScope ... } = Astro.props;
---

...
{mainTransitionScope && <meta name="vtbot-main-transition-scope" content={mainTransitionScope} />}
...
```
With one or more `transition:*` directives on an HTML element, Astro creates a new transition scope and links it to this element using the `data-astro-transition-scope` attribute.

The creation of the scope also works if the directives are _not_ used on an HTML element, but with an Astro component tag. In this case, the `data-astro-transition-scope` is created as an entry in the `Astro.props` object. It is lost if it is not handled explicitly.

The above declaration and code look for the value of the transition scope and embed it into the HTML using a `<meta>` element, if present. Now we have made the value available to client-side scripts, but it is not yet associated with an HTML element. We can now select any element, especially the `<main>` element of the content area.

And that is exactly what happens. The value is added as an `data-astro-transition-scope` attribute to the `<main>` element in the current document and in the `e.newDocument` that was just fetched by the loader.

ðŸ”“ So let's reveal what's behind  [Line 15](/jotter/starlight/integration/#connecting-to-starlight) of the StarlightConnector.

```ts title="astro-vtbot/components/starlight/StarlightConnector.astro" showLineNumbers=false
	function setMainTransitionScope(e: TransitionBeforePreparationEvent) {
		const meta = document.querySelector('meta[name="vtbot-main-transition-scope"]');
		if (!meta) return;
		const mainTransitionScope = (meta as HTMLMetaElement).content || 'none';
		setMainTransitionScope(document, mainTransitionScope);
		setMainTransitionScope(e.newDocument, mainTransitionScope);

		function setMainTransitionScope(doc: Document, value: string) {
			const main = doc.querySelector(STARLIGHT_MAIN_SECTION) as HTMLElement;
			main && (main.dataset.astroTransitionScope = value);
		}
	}
```
## Adding more Transitions
Currently, the `<main>` element is the only teleport destination. If you want to add more transitions without hacking Starlight, you can add `view-transition-name` values to elements using pure CSS.

### Example
Want to morph the old content title slowly into the new one (on browsers with native view transition support)? Then add this to [your `custom.css` file](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/css-and-tailwind/#custom-css-styles).
```css
main h1 {
  view-transition-name: title-heading
}
::view-transition-group(title-heading) {
	animation-duration: 1s;
}
```
